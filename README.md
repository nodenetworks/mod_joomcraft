This is a module that displays Minecraft game server status on Joomla! website as a module.
Currently it uses mcapi.us API to obtain server data but the plan is to also add mcstatus.io API and direct status check.
Another point for development would be to display the MOTD including the Minecraft Color Codes and Format Codes or at least strip these off as they are handled currently as a text.

It currently displays the following information:
- Minecraft server icon
- Online status
- MOTD (Message Tf The Day)
- Number of players and max number of players.

Each of displayed data can be switched on/off in the setting.

Appreciate all feedback!
